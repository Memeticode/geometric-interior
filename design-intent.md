# Design Intent

This system generates crystalline plane structures that appear to emerge
from light.

The objective is not photorealism, nor abstract chaos. The work exists
in tension:

-   mathematical precision and organic emergence  
-   architectural structure and energetic instability  
-   translucency and depth  
-   chromatic unity and internal spectral complexity

Each composition should feel governed by an underlying intelligence — a
hidden topology, manifold, or field — even when that structure is not
explicitly visible. Geometry must not feel arbitrary. It should feel
inevitable.

Planes are the primary structural unit. They are:

-   translucent  
-   depth-aware  
-   intersection-sensitive  
-   light-reactive

Light is not merely illumination. It is generative force. Geometry
should appear to condense from luminous nodes, fields, or flows.

Fractalization is controlled and scale-aware:

-   edges may subdivide  
-   fields may subtly perturb orientation  
-   light may modulate internally

Recursion exists, but it is intentional.  
The system favors taste over noise.

The compositional goal is psychological space:

-   depth without clutter  
-   tension without collapse  
-   structure without rigidity  
-   instability without chaos

Outputs should feel like still frames extracted from a living spatial
system — even when static.

Randomness must be deterministic. A seed should reproduce the structure
exactly.

This is not a particle explosion.  
It is not arbitrary mesh scattering.  
It is a field-governed crystalline architecture evolving inside light.
