GENERATED EXAMPLES – REFERENCE IMAGES SUMMARY

1)  prismatic-energy-intersections.png
    -   Dense, multi-core luminous intersections.
    -   Iridescent spectral refraction across translucent planar shards.
    -   High-energy, overlapping geometry with strong additive glow.
    -   Emphasis on light as structural origin.
2)  teal-volumetric-plane-burst.png
    -   Unified cyan/teal chromatic family.
    -   Off-axis luminous core with elongated crystalline planes.
    -   Strong depth attenuation and volumetric light feel.
    -   Softer spectral variation; more cohesive palette.
3)  faceted-iridescent-crystal-lattice.png
    -   Tightly interlocked polygonal shards with sharp edge definition.
    -   Highly reflective, glass-like surfaces.
    -   Strong edge geometry; architectural precision.
    -   Visible structural tension through intersecting facets.
4)  warm-spectrum-layered-field.png
    -   Unified warm gradient (gold, rose, violet blend).
    -   Layered 2.5D planar transparency stack.
    -   Controlled scale stratification (large sheets + medium shards).
    -   Calm but luminous psychological space.
5)  violet-depth-plane-cluster.png
    -   Monochrome violet spectrum.
    -   Deep space background with clustered translucent planes.
    -   Strong compositional coherence through narrow hue band.
    -   Emphasis on depth layering and soft internal glow.

GENERAL NOTES FOR GENERATIVE IMPLEMENTATION

-   All examples demonstrate translucent planar geometry with additive
    light blending.
-   Depth sorting, glow, and subtle internal texture are critical.
-   Variation axes include: chromatic unification, edge complexity,
    light distribution, and structural density.
-   These images are appropriate reference examples for a WebGL-based
    generative crystalline-plane system.
